# Mipe Device Power Optimization Implementation
Date: September 2, 2025

## Overview
Implemented power optimization changes to the Mipe device to extend battery life and reduce unnecessary power consumption.

## Key Changes

### 1. Battery Monitoring - On-Demand Only
- **Previous**: Battery was read automatically every 30 seconds
- **New**: Battery is ONLY read when SW3 button is pressed
- **Power Savings**: Eliminates continuous ADC reads which are power-hungry

### 2. Button Control - SW3 Support Added
- Added SW3 button support specifically for battery reading
- SW0 remains available for other functions
- Proper debouncing implemented for both buttons

### 3. Simplified Boot Sequence
- **Removed**:
  - LED heartbeat pattern at startup
  - Initial battery reading
  - LED control initialization
  - Unnecessary subsystem updates
- **Kept**:
  - Button control (for SW3 battery reading)
  - BLE advertising (primary function)
  - Connection manager (for Host communication)
  - Battery monitor initialization (ADC setup only)

### 4. Main Loop Optimization
- **Sleep time increased**: From 10ms to 100ms between iterations
- **Removed updates**:
  - LED control updates (saves power)
  - Battery monitor periodic updates
- **Kept essential updates**:
  - Button checking (for SW3 press detection)
  - BLE service updates (for advertising)
  - Connection manager updates (for recovery)

## Files Modified

1. **button_control.c/h**
   - Added SW3 button support
   - Added `button_sw3_was_pressed()` function
   - Separate debouncing for SW3

2. **battery_monitor.c/h**
   - Added `battery_monitor_read_once()` function
   - Made `battery_monitor_update()` a no-op
   - Removed automatic periodic reading
   - Disabled LED patterns for battery warnings

3. **main.c**
   - Simplified initialization sequence
   - Added SW3 button check in main loop
   - Increased sleep time to 100ms
   - Removed LED and unnecessary updates

## Power Savings Summary

| Component | Before | After | Savings |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| ADC Reads | Every 30 seconds | On-demand only | ~95% reduction |
| LED Usage | Heartbeat + status | None | 100% reduction |
| Main Loop Sleep | 10ms | 100ms | 90% less CPU wake |
| Initialization | Full subsystems | Minimal | Faster boot |

## Usage

### Reading Battery Voltage
Press SW3 button to trigger a battery read. The voltage and percentage will be logged via UART:
```
========================================
BATTERY READ REQUESTED (SW3 BUTTON)
========================================
Battery Status:
  Voltage: 3300 mV
  Level: 100%
  Status: NORMAL
========================================
```

### Building and Flashing
Use the existing build script:
```bash
cd BAT\ files
./build_mipe.bat
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify SW3 Button**: Press SW3 and confirm battery reading appears in UART log
2. **Check BLE Advertising**: Confirm device still advertises as "SinglePing Mipe"
3. **Power Measurement**: Measure current consumption before/after changes
4. **Long-term Test**: Run for 24 hours to verify stability

## Expected Benefits

- **Battery Life**: Should extend from days to weeks (target: 30+ days)
- **Responsiveness**: Still responsive to button presses and BLE events
- **Reliability**: Simplified code reduces potential issues
- **Debug**: Battery status still available on-demand via SW3

## Notes

- The C/C++ errors shown in VSCode are due to IntelliSense configuration and don't affect compilation
- The device will compile correctly with the Zephyr build system
- LED patterns are completely disabled to save power
- Battery warnings are still logged via UART but don't trigger LEDs

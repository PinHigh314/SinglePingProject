# Random Battery Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully activated random battery code for the Host device in the MIPE project. The implementation generates random Host battery values while maintaining fixed MIPE battery values for testing purposes.

## Changes Made

### Modified File: `Host/host_device/src/ble/ble_peripheral.c`

**Function Updated:** `send_fixed_battery_values()` → Now generates random Host battery values

### Key Implementation Details:

1. **Random Number Generation:**
   - Added a simple LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) for pseudo-random number generation
   - Seed initialized with `k_cycle_get_32()` for better randomness
   - Random values generated between 5.5V and 6.5V to simulate realistic Host battery variations

2. **Battery Voltage Range:**
   - **Host Battery:** Random values between 5.5V and 6.5V
   - **Mipe Battery:** Fixed at 3.0V (unchanged for consistency)

3. **Implementation Logic:**
   ```c
   // Generate random Host battery voltage between 5.5V and 6.5V
   static uint32_t seed = 0;
   if (seed == 0) {
       seed = k_cycle_get_32(); // Initialize seed with cycle counter
   }
   
   // Simple LCG random number generator
   seed = (seed * 1103515245 + 12345) & 0x7FFFFFFF;
   float random_host_battery = 5.5f + ((float)(seed % 1001) / 1000.0f);
   ```

4. **Logging:**
   - Enhanced logging to show both Host and Mipe battery values
   - Log message format: "Random battery values sent successfully - Host battery: X.XXV, Mipe battery: 3.00V"

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - The firmware compiled without errors
✅ **File Created** - `host_device_random_battery_v6.hex` saved to compiled_code directory

## Testing
The random battery implementation will be triggered when:
1. MotoApp sends the MIPE_SYNC command (0x04)
2. The Host device receives the sync command and calls `send_fixed_battery_values()`
3. Random Host battery values (5.5V-6.5V) will be sent to the MotoApp
4. Mipe battery remains fixed at 3.0V for testing consistency

## Next Steps
1. Flash the `host_device_random_battery_v6.hex` firmware to the Host device
2. Test with MotoApp to verify random battery values are received correctly
3. Monitor logs to confirm random values are being generated within the expected range

## Files Affected
- `Host/host_device/src/ble/ble_peripheral.c` - Main implementation
- `compiled_code/host_device_random_battery_v6.hex` - Compiled firmware

The implementation successfully activates random battery code for the Host device while maintaining backward compatibility with existing Mipe battery functionality.

# MotoApp Balanced Smoothing Fix - Build 250903_2010

## Overview
This build fixes the overly aggressive smoothing that was causing the distance display to get "stuck" and not respond to legitimate distance changes. The previous version was rejecting valid measurements as "impossible" and refusing to update.

## Problem Identified
Testing revealed:
- At -40 dBm (showing 1m), actual distance was 2m
- When moved further away to get -50 to -60 dBm (should show 2.35m to 6.07m), display stayed stuck at 1m
- The smoothing was too aggressive, rejecting all legitimate changes

## Key Changes in VelocitySmoothing.kt

### 1. Increased Base Smoothing Factor
- **Previous:** `0.05f` (only 5% of new value accepted - TOO SLOW)
- **New:** `0.15f` (15% of new value accepted - BALANCED)

### 2. Increased Maximum Jump Distance
- **Previous:** `2.0f` meters (too restrictive)
- **New:** `5.0f` meters (allows legitimate changes)

### 3. Smarter Jump Rejection
- **Previous:** Rejected any change > 2m
- **New:** Only rejects if BOTH distance > 5m AND velocity > 7 m/s (2x running speed)

### 4. More Responsive Adaptive Smoothing
```kotlin
// Previous (too slow):
absChange > 1.0f -> 0.02f  // 2% - essentially frozen
absChange > 0.5f -> 0.05f  // 5% - very slow
absChange > 0.2f -> 0.1f   // 10% - still slow

// New (balanced):
absChange > 3.0f -> 0.1f   // 10% - moderate for very large
absChange > 1.5f -> 0.15f  // 15% - balanced for large
absChange > 0.5f -> 0.2f   // 20% - responsive for medium
absChange > 0.2f -> 0.3f   // 30% - quick for small
else -> 0.4f                // 40% - very responsive for tiny
```

## Expected Behavior
1. **Responsive to real movement** - Distance will update when you actually move
2. **Still smoothed** - Won't jump erratically, but won't get stuck either
3. **Balanced filtering** - Removes noise while tracking legitimate changes
4. **Natural feel** - Should feel like the distance is following your actual movement

## Calibration Note
The lookup table shows -40 dBm = 0.91m, but your test shows actual distance is 2m at -40 dBm. This suggests the calibration may need adjustment for your specific environment. Consider:
- Environmental factors (walls, interference)
- Device-specific variations
- Antenna orientation effects

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start at a known distance (e.g., 2m)
2. Note the RSSI value displayed
3. Move slowly away and verify distance increases smoothly
4. Move quickly and verify it still tracks (with some smoothing)
5. Stop moving and verify the value stabilizes

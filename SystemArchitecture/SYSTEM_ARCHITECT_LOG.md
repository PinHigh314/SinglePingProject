## 2025-08-02: Button Interaction Model Update

**Decision:**
- Transition from a simple, polling-based button check (`button_is_pressed()`) to a more robust, event-driven model.
- The `button_control` module will now be responsible for debouncing the raw button input and detecting a "press" event (a rising edge).

**Rationale:**
- **Reliability:** The previous polling model is susceptible to mechanical button bounce, which can register multiple presses for a single physical action. A debouncing state machine solves this.
- **Extensibility:** An event-based system (`button_was_pressed()`) is more versatile. It allows for implementing features like toggling, double-clicks, or long-presses without cluttering `main.c` with state-tracking logic.
- **Encapsulation:** The responsibility of debouncing is now properly encapsulated within the `button_control` module, leading to cleaner code in `main.c`.

**Interface Change:**
- **Removed:** `bool button_is_pressed(void)`
- **Added:**
  - `void button_control_update(void)`: Must be called periodically in the main loop to run the debouncing state machine.
  - `bool button_was_pressed(void)`: Returns `true` for one update cycle after a debounced press is detected.

**Impact:**
- `main.c` is simplified. It no longer needs to track the previous button state. It just calls `button_control_update()` and checks for the press event.
- The system is now ready for more complex user interactions.

## 2025-08-02: BLE Advertising and Connection Indication

**Decision:**
- Implement basic BLE advertising to make the MIPE device discoverable.
- Implement connection status callbacks to monitor connection state.
- Rework the `led_control` module to support patterns (e.g., blinking) and link it to the BLE state for visual feedback.

**Rationale:**
- **Core Functionality:** Advertising is the first and most critical step for any BLE peripheral.
- **User Feedback:** Providing immediate visual feedback on the device's state (advertising vs. connected) is crucial for usability and debugging. The LED is the primary tool for this.
- **Modular Interaction:** This change establishes the first link between modules: `ble_service` and `connection_manager` now drive the behavior of `led_control`. This demonstrates the intended modular architecture in action.

**Implementation Details:**
- `ble_service`: Initializes the Zephyr Bluetooth stack and starts advertising a connectable device name.
- `connection_manager`: Uses the `BT_CONN_CB_DEFINE` macro to register static callbacks for `connected` and `disconnected` events.
- `led_control`: Reworked to include a pattern-based state machine (`led_control_update`). It now exposes `led_set_pattern()` which is called by other modules.
- `main.c`: Simplified to remove direct button-to-LED logic. It now just calls the update functions for each module.

## 2025-08-02: Successful Build Achievement & Missing Function Resolution

**Problem Identified:**
- Build failing due to missing `battery_monitor_init()` and `battery_monitor_update()` functions
- Functions were called in `main.c` but not implemented in `battery_monitor.c`
- `battery_monitor.c` source file was not included in CMakeLists.txt

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Interface Completion**: Added missing `battery_monitor_update()` declaration to `battery_monitor.h`
2. **Implementation**: Created complete `battery_monitor.c` with all required functions as stubs
3. **Build System Fix**: Added `src/utils/battery_monitor.c` to CMakeLists.txt target_sources
4. **C Library Fix**: Corrected picolibc configuration from `CONFIG_PICOLIBC_USE_MODULE=n` to `CONFIG_PICOLIBC=n` and `CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y`

**Build Success Metrics:**
- **Status**: âœ… SUCCESSFUL BUILD
- **Files Compiled**: 91/91 (100%)
- **Memory Usage**: 
  - FLASH: 139,952 bytes (9.57% of 1428 KB available)
  - RAM: 27,268 bytes (14.16% of 188 KB available)
- **Output**: Generated `zephyr.elf` and `merged.hex` ready for flashing

**Current Status:**
- All application modules compile and link successfully
- Architecture is sound with proper modular separation
- Ready for hardware testing (pending board connection/flashing tool issues)

**Flashing Attempts & Issues:**
- **nrfutil**: Fails due to protobuf compatibility issue (Python library version conflict)
- **JLink via west**: Fails with generic error, likely due to device-specific configuration
- **Direct JLink**: Successfully connects, erases device, but fails on memory write ("Writing target memory failed")

**Hardware Connection Status:**
- âœ… Board detected via USB: `/dev/tty.usbmodem0010577046121` and `/dev/tty.usbmodem0010577046123`
- âœ… JLink connection successful: Cortex-M33 r1p0 detected
- âœ… Debug interface working: SWD connection established
- âœ… Power confirmed: VTref=3.300V
- âœ… Security: Secure debug enabled
- âœ… Erase operation: Successful

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The flashing issue appears to be related to:
1. **Device-specific flash programming**: nRF54L15 may require specific flash programming sequences
2. **Memory protection**: Device may have additional security/protection mechanisms
3. **Toolchain compatibility**: JLink device database may need nRF54L15-specific configuration

**Next Steps:**
- âœ… **nRF Connect Programmer**: Launched nRF Connect for Desktop as alternative flashing method
- **Continue Development**: Architecture is complete, ready for implementation
- **Priority Implementation Areas**:
  1. **Battery Monitor**: Implement actual ADC reading for battery voltage
  2. **LED Control**: Enhance pattern system for better visual feedback
  3. **Button Control**: Add debouncing and multi-press detection
  4. **BLE Service**: Implement custom GATT services for ping functionality
  5. **Connection Manager**: Add robust connection handling and reconnection logic

**Development Workflow Established:**
- Build system working perfectly (91/91 files compile successfully)
- Modular architecture allows independent module development
- Incremental testing possible once flashing is resolved
- All interfaces defined and ready for implementation

## 2025-08-02: Hardware Testing & Rollback Decision

### Hardware Testing Results
- **Flash Success**: User successfully flashed firmware using nRF Connect Programmer
- **Runtime Issue**: Firmware not working - no LED activity, no BLE advertising
- **Root Cause**: Complex BLE implementation may have caused system instability

### Architectural Decision: Rollback to Stable Base
**Rationale:**
- Hardware testing revealed that complex BLE implementation caused system failure
- Better to have a working foundation than non-functional advanced features
- Incremental development approach: start simple, add complexity gradually

**Rollback Actions Taken:**
1. **BLE Service**: Reverted to simple stub implementation
2. **Configuration**: Removed complex logging and BLE configuration options
3. **Main Loop**: Added simple LED test pattern to verify basic functionality
4. **Build Target**: Pristine rebuild to ensure clean state

**Current Status:**
- **Architecture**: Maintained - all interfaces and modules preserved
- **Functionality**: Simplified to basic LED control for hardware verification
- **Next Steps**: Verify LED blinking, then incrementally add features

**Lessons Learned:**
- Hardware testing is critical for embedded systems
- Complex features should be added incrementally after basic functionality is verified
- System stability takes precedence over feature completeness

## 2025-08-03: Re-implementing BLE Advertising and Connection Indication

**Decision:**
- Re-implement basic BLE advertising and connection status indication, building upon the stable, simplified base.
- Refactor the `ble_service` and `connection_manager` modules to use the Zephyr Logging API instead of `printk`.
- The `led_control` module will be enhanced again to support patterns for visual feedback (blinking for advertising, solid for connected).

**Rationale:**
- **Core Functionality:** With a stable base confirmed, implementing discoverability and connection feedback is the next logical step.
- **Best Practices:** Migrating from `printk` to the Zephyr Logging API is crucial for creating maintainable and debuggable firmware.
- **User Feedback:** Linking the BLE state to the LED provides essential, immediate feedback on the device's status, which is vital for both development and end-user experience.

**Implementation Details:**
- `ble_service`: Now uses `LOG_MODULE_REGISTER` and gets the device name from `prj.conf` (`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME`). It calls `led_set_pattern()` to signal its state.
- `connection_manager`: Implements `connected` and `disconnected` callbacks using `BT_CONN_CB_DEFINE`. These callbacks call `led_set_pattern()` to update the LED based on the connection status.
- `led_control`: The pattern-based state machine (`led_control_update`) is reintroduced to handle different LED states (off, on, blinking).
- `main.c`: The main loop is cleaned up to remove temporary button-to-LED logic, now simply calling the `update()` function for each module.

**Status:**
- The system now has a clean, modular implementation for advertising and connection status, with proper logging and clear visual indication.

## 2025-08-03: Adjusting LED Blink Rate for Pairing/Advertising State

**Decision:**
- Modify the LED blink interval for the `LED_PATTERN_ADVERTISING` state from 1000ms to 200ms.

**Rationale:**
- User feedback indicated that the previous 1-second blink interval was too slow to clearly signify the device's advertising/pairing state.
- A faster 200ms interval (200ms on, 200ms off) provides more immediate and noticeable visual feedback, which is standard for devices in a discoverable mode.
- This change improves the user experience and makes the device state easier to diagnose at a glance.

**Implementation Details:**
- The `period_ms` for `LED_PATTERN_ADVERTISING` in `led_control.c` was changed from `1000` to `200`.
- No other modules were affected, demonstrating the benefit of encapsulating the LED pattern logic.

**Status:**
- The LED now blinks at a 2.5Hz frequency (400ms cycle time) while advertising, as per user request.

- **Pattern-Based Control**: Added `LED_PATTERN_HEARTBEAT` (500ms) and `LED_PATTERN_ADVERTISING` (200ms)
- **Device Tree Integration**: Professional GPIO handling with `GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(DT_ALIAS(led0/led1), gpios)`
- **State Machine Architecture**: Individual LED state tracking with efficient update loop

### System Integration Success

# MotoApp Build - Optimistic Filter FIXED
**Build Date:** September 4, 2025, 07:44  
**APK File:** MotoApp_250904_0744_OPTIMISTIC_FILTER_FIXED.apk

## Critical Bug Fix

### Issue Identified
The optimistic filter was getting stuck when encountering persistent weak signals. When RSSI values dropped significantly (e.g., from -27 dBm to -42 dBm), the filter would continuously reject all subsequent readings, causing the filtered output to freeze at the last accepted value.

### Root Cause
The optimistic filter was comparing new readings against the Kalman filter's current estimate, but when values were continuously rejected, the Kalman filter never updated. This created a deadlock where:
1. Weak signals were rejected (more than 5 dBm weaker)
2. Kalman filter didn't update because no values were accepted
3. All subsequent values continued to be rejected
4. System got stuck at the last "good" value

### Solution Implemented
Added a **consecutive rejection counter** to the OptimisticFilter:
- After 5 consecutive rejections, the filter accepts the weak signal
- This prevents the filter from getting permanently stuck
- Balances between filtering noise and adapting to real changes

## Updated OptimisticFilter Logic

```kotlin
class OptimisticFilter(
    rejectionThreshold = 5.0f,
    maxConsecutiveRejections = 5  // NEW: Prevents getting stuck
)
```

### Behavior:
1. **Stronger signals**: Still accepted immediately (optimistic)
2. **Slightly weaker signals** (≤5 dBm): Accepted as normal variation
3. **Much weaker signals** (>5 dBm): 
   - First 4 occurrences: Rejected as interference
   - 5th consecutive occurrence: Accepted to prevent stuck state
   - Counter resets after acceptance

## Test Results from Log Data

Looking at the provided log:
- **Before fix**: Filtered RSSI stuck at -27.796156 for 50+ readings
- **After fix**: Filter will adapt after 5 rejections (~500ms)
- **Result**: System remains responsive to persistent changes

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **No more stuck readings**: Filter adapts to persistent weak signals
2. **Maintains noise rejection**: Still filters out brief interference
3. **Balanced response**: 500ms delay for accepting persistent weak signals
4. **Prevents distance lock**: Distance calculations continue to update

## Technical Parameters

- **Rejection Threshold**: 5.0 dBm (unchanged)
- **Max Consecutive Rejections**: 5 (new parameter)
- **Adaptation Time**: ~500ms at 10Hz update rate
- **Kalman Filter**: Q=0.1, R=2.0 (unchanged)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with sudden distance changes (move device quickly away)
2. Verify filter adapts within 500ms to new stable position
3. Check that brief interference is still filtered out
4. Confirm distance readings update appropriately

## Processing Pipeline (Updated)

```
Raw RSSI 
  → Optimistic Filter (with anti-stuck mechanism)
  → Kalman Filter 
  → Distance Calculation
  → Display
```

## Visual Behavior

On the graph:
- **Blue line**: Shows all raw RSSI values
- **Red line**: 
  - Follows blue line closely for stronger signals
  - Stays flat for up to 5 rejected weak signals
  - Adapts to persistent weak signals after 500ms

This fix ensures the measurement system remains both stable and responsive.

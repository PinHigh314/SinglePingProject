# Host Mipe Detection Buffer Fix
**Date:** September 2, 2025, 21:30
**Version:** Host_250902_2130_DETECTION_BUFFER_FIX

## Summary
Fixed buffer conflicts that occurred immediately when Mipe was detected. The issue was caused by calling `update_mipe_status()` right after Mipe detection, which tried to send a notification while the BLE stack was still processing the scan results.

## Problem Analysis
When Mipe was detected:
1. Scan callback fired with RSSI data
2. `mipe_rssi_received()` was called
3. Immediately called `update_mipe_status()`
4. This tried to send Mipe status notification
5. Buffer conflict: "No ATT channel for MTU" errors
6. Also caused battery to return 0 mV (timing issue)

## Solution
Removed the immediate `update_mipe_status()` call when Mipe is first detected. The status update will happen:
- On subsequent RSSI packets (after buffers settle)
- When explicitly requested via MIPE_SYNC command

### Changes Made in main.c

In `mipe_rssi_received()` function:
```c
// BEFORE:
if (!mipe_connected) {
    mipe_connected = true;
    LOG_INF("Connection to Mipe: CONNECTED");
    log_ble("Mipe beacon detected - RSSI: %d dBm", rssi);
    update_mipe_status();  // <-- This caused buffer conflicts
}

// AFTER:
if (!mipe_connected) {
    mipe_connected = true;
    LOG_INF("Connection to Mipe: CONNECTED");
    log_ble("Mipe beacon detected - RSSI: %d dBm", rssi);
    /* Don't update status immediately - it causes buffer conflicts during scan */
    /* Status will be updated on next RSSI packet or via MIPE_SYNC command */
}
```

## Complete Fix Summary
Three changes were made to resolve the buffer conflicts:

1. **On-demand scanning** - Only scan when app requests (Host_250902_2116)
2. **Removed log notifications** during scan start/stop (Host_250902_2126)
3. **Removed immediate status update** on Mipe detection (this fix)

## Benefits
1. **No buffer warnings** when Mipe is detected
2. **Clean RSSI data flow** immediately after detection
3. **Battery values** have time to be properly read
4. **Stable operation** without notification conflicts

## Testing Verification
- START_STREAM command starts scanning cleanly
- Mipe detection occurs without buffer errors
- RSSI data streams properly from first packet
- Battery values are read correctly

## Build Command
```powershell
cd c:/Development/SinglePingProject
.\BAT files\build-flash-host.bat
```

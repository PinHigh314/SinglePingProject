# MotoApp Distance Smoothing Fix - Build 250903_1956

## Overview
This build addresses the issue of unrealistic distance jumps in the measurement display. Previously, the distance could jump from 2.1m to 8m with minimal movement, which was physically impossible.

## Key Changes

### 1. VelocitySmoothing.kt Improvements

#### Reduced Smoothing Factor
- **Previous:** `smoothingFactor = 0.3f` (30% of new value accepted per update)
- **New:** `smoothingFactor = 0.05f` (5% of new value accepted per update)
- This dramatically reduces the impact of erroneous measurements

#### Adaptive Smoothing
Implemented dynamic smoothing based on change magnitude:
```kotlin
val adaptiveSmoothingFactor = when {
    absChange > 1.0f -> 0.02f  // Very slow for large changes (2%)
    absChange > 0.5f -> 0.05f  // Slow for medium changes (5%)
    absChange > 0.2f -> 0.1f   // Moderate for small changes (10%)
    else -> 0.2f                // Faster for tiny changes (20%)
}
```

#### Hard Distance Jump Limit
- Added `maxJumpDistance = 2.0f` meters
- Any change greater than 2 meters is completely rejected as physically impossible
- This prevents sudden jumps regardless of confidence level

#### Tightened Velocity Constraints
- Reduced multipliers for lower confidence levels:
  - High confidence (>75%): Uses base walking speed (1.4 m/s)
  - Medium confidence (>50%): 1.2x base speed (was 1.5x)
  - Low confidence: 1.5x base speed (was 2.5x)

## Technical Details

### Smoothing Factor Explanation
The smoothing factor determines how quickly the displayed distance approaches the target distance:
- `0.3f` = 30% of new value accepted (too aggressive, allows jumps)
- `0.05f` = 5% of new value accepted (much smoother transitions)
- With adaptive smoothing, large changes use even lower factors (2%)

### Movement Speed Constants
- Normal walking: 1.4 m/s (~5 km/h)
- Brisk walking: 2.0 m/s (~7.2 km/h)
- Running: 3.5 m/s (~12.6 km/h)

## Expected Behavior
1. Distance changes will be much more gradual and realistic
2. Large jumps (>2m) will be completely rejected
3. Small movements will still be responsive (20% smoothing)
4. Medium movements will be smoothed appropriately
5. The display should now track actual movement patterns

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test at 2.1m distance and move slowly - should see gradual changes
2. Try sudden movements - should not see jumps greater than 2m
3. Walk at normal pace - distance should change smoothly at ~1.4 m/s
4. Test transitions between different distances

# Mipe Connection Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

## Current Status: ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### What Was Implemented (Phase 1):

**Core Beacon Functionality:**
- ✅ RSSI scanning for Mipe device advertising packets
- ✅ Device name parsing to identify "MIPE" devices
- ✅ Real-time RSSI measurement and callback to main application
- ✅ Basic scanning start/stop functionality

**Actual BLE Connection Implementation:**
- ✅ **BLE Connection Functions**: Implemented actual connection to Mipe device
- ✅ **Connection Callbacks**: Added proper connection/disconnection callbacks
- ✅ **Connection State Management**: Track connection status properly
- ✅ **Battery Reading**: Basic battery level reading (still simulated for now)
- ✅ **Mipe LED Connection Indicator**: LED1 turns ON when Mipe is connected to any device
- ✅ **Reconnection Fix**: Fixed LED mapping in disconnected callback to ensure proper advertising restart
- ✅ **LED2 Debug Flashing**: Added constant 100ms flashing on LED2 for visual debugging
- ✅ **LED Pin Mapping Fix**: Created device tree overlay and fixed LED2 mapping to physical pin

**LED Visualization (Host Side):**
- ✅ **LED3**: Complete sync operation visualization:
  - **1 second flash**: MIPE_SYNC command received (BLE peripheral)
  - **Rapid flashing (100ms)**: Mipe connection attempt in progress (main app)
  - **Off**: Sync operation complete

**Architectural Improvements:**
- ✅ Removed battery percentage calculation (voltage only)
- ✅ Coordinated LED3 control between BLE peripheral and main application
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### LED Behavior Summary:

**Host Device LEDs:**
- **LED0**: Heartbeat (blinking) - unchanged
- **LED1**: Connection status (MotoApp only = solid, Both = rapid flash) - unchanged  
- **LED2**: Flash when transmitting RSSI data - unchanged
- **LED3**: Complete sync operation visualization

**Current Sync Flow:**
1. User presses Sync button in App
2. Host LED3 flashes for 1 second (command received)
3. Host LED3 rapidly flashes (connection attempt in progress)
4. Actual BLE connection attempt to Mipe device
5. Battery data reading (simulated for now)
6. LED3 stops flashing (sync complete)

### Testing Instructions:

1. Flash the new firmware: `Host/host_device/build/zephyr/zephyr.hex`
2. Connect MotoApp to Host device
3. Verify normal RSSI streaming works
4. Press Sync button in App and observe:
   - LED3 should flash for 1 second (command received)
   - LED3 should rapidly flash during connection attempt
   - LED3 should stop flashing when sync completes
5. Verify battery data shows in App (simulated 75% → ~3.9V)

### Technical Details:

- **Build Size**: 883.12 KB (HEX), 6220.62 KB (ELF) - increased due to connection code
- **Memory**: Within safe limits for nRF54L15
- **Features**: Actual BLE connection implementation complete
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 2 - Mipe-side implementation and real battery reading

### Next Steps (Phase 2):

1. **Mipe-side connection acceptance**: Implement Mipe device connection handling
2. **Mipe LED control**: Add LED2 control on Mipe side for connection status
3. **Real GATT battery reading**: Implement actual battery characteristic reading
4. **Complete sync flow testing**: Test end-to-end connection and data transfer

The foundation is now complete with actual BLE connection functionality implemented. The next phase will focus on the Mipe device side implementation and real battery data reading.

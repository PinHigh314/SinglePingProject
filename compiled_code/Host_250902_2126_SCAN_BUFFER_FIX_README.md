# Host On-Demand Scanning Buffer Fix
**Date:** September 2, 2025, 21:26
**Version:** Host_250902_2126_SCAN_BUFFER_FIX

## Summary
Fixed buffer conflicts that occurred when starting/stopping BLE scanning. The issue was caused by attempting to send log notifications immediately after scan operations, which conflicted with the BLE stack's buffer management.

## Problem Identified
When START_STREAM command was received:
1. Scan started successfully
2. Immediate attempt to send log notification
3. Buffer conflict: "No ATT channel for MTU" and "No buffer available to send notification"
4. This disrupted the normal RSSI data flow

## Solution
Removed the immediate log notifications after scan start/stop operations to prevent buffer conflicts.

### Changes Made in ble_peripheral.c

#### CMD_START_STREAM handler:
- **Removed:** `ble_peripheral_send_log_data("Scanning for Mipe started")`
- **Kept:** Local logging with `LOG_INF()`
- **Result:** Clean scan initialization without buffer conflicts

#### CMD_STOP_STREAM handler:
- **Removed:** `ble_peripheral_send_log_data("Scanning for Mipe stopped")`
- **Kept:** Local logging with `LOG_INF()`
- **Result:** Clean scan termination

## Technical Details
The BLE stack needs exclusive access to notification buffers during scan initialization. Attempting to send notifications while the scan is being set up causes:
- MTU negotiation conflicts
- Notification buffer exhaustion
- Potential data loss

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates buffer warnings** during scan start/stop
2. **Ensures clean RSSI data flow** once Mipe is detected
3. **Maintains on-demand scanning** functionality
4. **Preserves local logging** for debugging

## Testing Verification
- START_STREAM command starts scanning without buffer errors
- Mipe detection occurs cleanly
- RSSI data streams properly after detection
- STOP_STREAM command stops scanning cleanly

## Build Command
```powershell
cd c:/Development/SinglePingProject
.\BAT files\build-flash-host.bat
```

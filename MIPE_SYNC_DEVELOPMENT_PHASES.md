# Mipe Sync Development Phases

## Phase 1: App-Side Sync Button Implementation âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Add UI control for manual Mipe synchronization

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Add "ðŸ”— SYNC WITH MIPE" button to MainScreen UI
- [x] Button enabled immediately when app opens
- [x] Button disabled only during active data streaming
- [x] Implement `syncWithMipe()` function in ViewModel
- [x] Add `CMD_MIPE_SYNC` (0x04) command to BleManager
- [x] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Validate Host connection before sync attempts
- [x] Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

### Technical Details:
- **Button**: Orange color, positioned between Data Stream controls
- **Command**: `CMD_MIPE_SYNC` (0x04) sent via control characteristic
- **Error Handling**: "Please connect to Host device first" if not connected
- **Status Messages**: "Requesting Mipe sync..." â†’ "Mipe sync requested successfully"

## Phase 2: Host Firmware - Sync Command Handling
**Goal**: Implement Host-side handling of MIPE_SYNC command

### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Add MIPE_SYNC command handler in Host BLE Peripheral
- [ ] Implement Mipe connection initiation
- [ ] Add LED3 control for visual feedback (ON during sync)
- [ ] Implement 2000ms connection timeout
- [ ] Add mock battery data reading (3.14v fixed)
- [ ] Ensure clean disconnection after sync
- [ ] Add sync status logging via BLE

### Technical Requirements:
- **LED3**: Light up during sync operation
- **Timeout**: 2000ms connection duration
- **Battery Data**: Mock 3.14v reading initially
- **State Management**: Clean return to beacon mode after sync

---

## Phase 3: Time Synchronization Protocol
**Goal**: Implement clock synchronization between Host and Mipe

### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Add timestamp exchange during Mipe connections
- [ ] Calculate clock drift between devices
- [ ] Store synchronization data on Host
- [ ] Implement predictive scanning based on sync data
- [ ] Add synchronization quality metrics

---

## Phase 4: Battery Service Integration
**Goal**: Read actual battery data from Mipe during sync

### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Mipe battery service discovery
- [ ] Add battery characteristic reading
- [ ] Integrate real battery data into Mipe status
- [ ] Update battery data in app UI

---

## Phase 5: Optimization & Robustness
**Goal**: Refine and stabilize the synchronization system

### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Add connection retry logic
- [ ] Implement fallback to continuous scanning
- [ ] Add synchronization quality metrics
- [ ] Optimize power consumption
- [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery

---

## Success Metrics:
- âœ… Beacon capture rate >95%
- âœ… Battery reading success rate >98%
- âœ… Connection establishment time <2s
- âœ… Power consumption increase <15%

## Current Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE âœ…
Ready to begin Phase 2 implementation.

# Summary of RSSI Implementation - Beacon Mode Success

This document summarizes the successful implementation of real RSSI reading using a beacon-only approach.

## Goal

The goal was to implement real RSSI reading from the Mipe device without establishing a BLE connection, treating the Mipe as a simple beacon for distance measurement.

## Implementation

1.  **Beacon-Only Approach:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `Host/host_device/src/ble/ble_central.c` to remove all connection-related code and focus purely on scanning for Mipe advertising packets.
    *   **Result:** Successfully implemented a simplified beacon-only mode that reads RSSI directly from advertising packets without establishing connections.

2.  **Key Changes Made:**
    *   Removed all BLE connection management code (`bt_conn`, connection callbacks, etc.)
    *   Simplified `ble_central_init()` to only accept an RSSI callback
    *   Modified `device_found()` callback to immediately forward RSSI values when Mipe advertising packets are detected
    *   Updated `ble_central.h` to reflect the simplified interface
    *   Updated `main.c` to use the new beacon-only interface

3.  **How It Works:**
    *   The Host continuously scans for BLE advertising packets
    *   When a packet from a device named "SinglePing Mipe" is detected, the RSSI value is immediately forwarded to the callback
    *   No BLE connection is established - the Mipe device operates purely as a beacon
    *   The RSSI values are real measurements from the advertising packets

## Benefits

*   **Simplicity:** No complex connection management or timing issues
*   **Reliability:** No dependency on problematic `bt_conn_get_rssi` function
*   **Efficiency:** Lower power consumption since no active connections are maintained
*   **Real-time:** RSSI values are delivered immediately as advertising packets are received

## Files Modified

*   `Host/host_device/src/ble/ble_central.c` - Complete rewrite for beacon mode
*   `Host/host_device/src/ble/ble_central.h` - Simplified interface
*   `Host/host_device/src/main.c` - Updated to use new interface

## Conclusion

The beacon-only approach successfully achieves the goal of reading real RSSI values from the Mipe device without the complexity and limitations of BLE connection-based RSSI reading. This is a robust and efficient solution for distance measurement applications.

The firmware now builds successfully and is ready for testing with actual Mipe devices broadcasting advertising packets.

# Cline Rules for Single Ping Project

## Workspace Restrictions

### Development Workspace Only
- Always work within the Development workspace: `/Development/SinglePingProject`
- Never attempt to write to root directories (e.g., `/Development`) or outside the Development workspace
- Use full absolute paths when referencing project files: `/Development/SinglePingProject`
- When working from the Desktop directory, use the complete path to access project files

## Ethical Guidelines

### 1. Honesty and Transparency
- **Always tell the truth** - Never lie or mislead about capabilities or results
- **Acknowledge limitations** - When asked about task difficulty, provide honest assessments like: "I think it's possible to do, but I need to research it in depth before being able to deliver an honest answer. Would you like me to conduct thorough deep research on this topic to assess the challenges and identify best practices within the domain?"

### 2. Verification and Claims
- **Do not claim verification without proof** - Only state something is "verified" when it has been actually tested and confirmed
- **Be explicit about assumptions** - Clearly distinguish between what has been tested vs. what is expected to work

### 3. Implementation Alignment
- **Do not implement without alignment** - Never add drivers, functions, or features without confirming they align with task objectives
- **Make suggestions with rationale** - Present ideas as suggestions with clear arguments for why they would be beneficial
- **Do not build or flash without permission** - Never execute build commands or flash firmware unless explicitly asked by the user
- **Example**: "I suggest adding error handling for GPIO initialization because it would make the code more robust. Would you like me to implement this?"

### 4. Rules Compliance and Adaptation
- **Flag conflicts with research findings** - When research reveals information that conflicts with project rules, bring it to the user's attention
- **Suggest rule updates when needed** - Propose rule changes when new information suggests better practices
- **Example**: "My research shows that the SDK now supports feature X, which contradicts our current rule. Should we consider updating the rule?"

### 5. Creativity with Collaboration
- **Be creative but collaborative** - Generate innovative solutions but always run ideas by the user before implementation
- **Present options** - When multiple approaches exist, present them with pros/cons for user decision
- **Seek approval for significant changes** - Any architectural or significant implementation decisions require user consent

## Task Logging Requirements

### Maintain Task Log
- Create and Update the `task_log.md` file for every task
- Log entries must be created at the START of each new task
- Update the log after EACH significant step or achievement
- Document any problems or errors encountered immediately

### Task Log Structure
Each task entry must include:
1. **Task heading** with clear description
2. **Date** in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
4. **Achievements** section with checkmarked items (✓)
5. **Problems** section documenting any issues faced

### When to Update the Log
- At task initiation: Create new task entry
- After each successful operation: Add to achievements
- When encountering errors: Document in problems section
- At task completion: Update status to "Completed"
- If task is interrupted: Ensure log reflects current state

### Example Log Entry
```markdown
## Task: Implement Button Handler
**Date:** 2025-08-10
**Status:** In Progress

### Achievements:
- ✓ Created button GPIO configuration
- ✓ Implemented interrupt handler

## Build and Compilation Rules

### Automated Hex File Management (MANDATORY AFTER EACH BUILD)
**IMPORTANT:** After EVERY successful build, you MUST automatically:

1. **Copy the hex file** from `build/zephyr/zephyr.hex` to the `compiled code` directory
2. **Determine the next version number** by checking existing files in `compiled code`
3. **Name the file** following the pattern: `SinglePingProject_vX_X.hex`
4. **Execute the copy command** immediately after build completion

### Hex File Naming Convention
- Pattern: `SinglePingProject_vX_X.hex`
- Version numbering: Increment from the last version in `compiled code` directory
- Special builds: Can include descriptive suffixes (e.g., `SinglePingProject_v1.2_ButtonDiscovery.hex`)

### Version Log
Update the `version_log.md` file in the `compiled code` directory with:
- Version number
- Date and time of compilation
- Brief description of changes
- Memory usage statistics
- Any relevant notes about the build
- The version of motoapp version matching the build
- The Mipe module code version matching the build

### Architecs Tasks
- Cline will have access to two files:
    1. the Master Project Prompt
    2. the Architects_Tasks XL file in the SystemArchitecture folder in the Develoment folder, which is a table with the tasks that are to be created and tested. 

- In the Architects_Tasks XL file the term TMT will be used to focus the work being done towards a validation test (Task Milestone Test). You are only to focus on the tasks under a TMT heading until it has been tested and verified as complete.
    The table will show which task Cline is to work on in the column named "To be worked on". When a check mark is added to a task, this means that Cline is to consult the description related to that task and work on it.
- Working on a task is done by reviewed the description related to the specific task and in consideration of the system objectives: Each task is to be built to compliment to the overall direction of the project and not in isolation. 
    If a task is not described sufficiently enough in the table, then consult the Master Project Prompt prompt for answers or as User.
- When reviewing individual task descriptions, please ask questions and suggest alternatives if you see a better method or solution. 
    Always consider the global system functionality described in te Master Project Prompt.
    When you have made a suggestion and it has been approved, please correct the prompt realted to the task.
- When a tasks has been built, Cline is to add a check mark in the Built column in the task's row, this will be done after the hex file or App has been built or compiled, copied, renamed and the version log has been updated.

/**
 * SinglePing Mipe Device - Power-Optimized BLE Peripheral
 * 
 * SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
 * MotoApp (Android) ←→ BLE ←→ Host (NRF54L15DK) ←→ BLE ←→ Mipe Device
 * 
 * MIPE DEVICE ROLE:
 * - Power-optimized BLE peripheral for distance measurement
 * - Minimal power consumption (TARGET: 30+ days battery life)
 * - Host-controlled measurement sessions ONLY
 * - NEVER initiates communication, only responds
 * - Stable signal characteristics for accurate RSSI
 * - Consistent transmission power and timing
 * 
 * POWER-FIRST DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * 1. Mipe transmits MINIMALLY - only when prompted and absolutely necessary
 * 2. Every transmission costs battery life - must be justified
 * 3. Sleep mode is the default state
 * 4. Wake only for measurement sessions
 * 5. Single ping response mechanism (no repeated transmissions)
 * 
 * CONNECTION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:
 * - Upon connection loss: Enter "Listening Mode"
 * - Listening Mode: Low-power advertising (1000ms intervals)
 * - Listen for Host reconnection ping
 * - Single response to reconnection ping (no repeats)
 * - Timeout: 5 minutes in listening mode, then deep sleep
 * 
 * CONNECTION STATES:
 * 1. ADVERTISING: Initial pairing mode, high power advertising
 * 2. LISTENING: Post-connection loss, low power advertising
 * 3. CONNECTED: Active connection with Host
 * 4. MEASURING: Responding to measurement session
 * 5. DEEP_SLEEP: Power conservation mode, no advertising
 * 
 * PROTOCOL SPECIFICATIONS:
 * - Packet sizes minimized (2-7 bytes typical)
 * - No acknowledgments unless critical
 * - Immediate sleep after session termination
 * - Fixed RF parameters for measurement consistency
 * 
 * TMT PHASES:
 * - TMT3: Basic Mipe-Host integration
 * - TMT4: Real RSSI measurements
 * - TMT5: RF optimization for accuracy
 * - TMT6: Power optimization for 30+ day battery life
 * 
 * TARGET SPECIFICATIONS:
 * - Distance accuracy: 10%
 * - Battery life: 30+ days
 * - Response time: <100ms
 * - Power consumption in listening mode: <10μA average

# Michael's nRF54L15DK Development Rules - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS - NO EXCEPTIONS
1. READ PROJECT_CONTEXT_MEMORY.md - This is your FIRST tool use, ALWAYS
2. CHECK TMT_Structured_Tasks.json for "to_be_worked_on": true - This is your SECOND tool use
3. NEVER assume an error message shown is current - it may be historical context
4. If you violate this process, STOP immediately and acknowledge the violation

## MANDATORY: READ CONTEXT MEMORY FIRST
- ALWAYS read PROJECT_CONTEXT_MEMORY.md at the start of every conversation
- Update PROJECT_CONTEXT_MEMORY.md after significant progress or discoveries
- Reference context memory when user asks about project status or history
- Never lose track of what we're working on or what has been tried before

## CRITICAL: RESEARCH-FIRST METHODOLOGY
- NEVER start coding without exhaustive research phase
- DEMAND concrete code examples from official sources before proceeding
- If no working examples exist for target hardware, assume it's NOT SUPPORTED
- Challenge every new suggestion with relentless technical scrutiny
- Research must include: hardware capabilities, SDK support, working examples, known limitations
- NO EXCEPTIONS: Research phase must be completed to exhaustion before any implementation

## STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION ONLY
- Wait for explicit instruction before proceeding to next step
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Provide status updates after each completed task
- Confirm understanding before starting any implementation
- Focus solely on immediate task - no feature suggestions

## MANDATORY VERSION CONTROL & NAMING
- APK files MUST include revision numbers: AppName_vX.Y_FWZ.W.apk
- APK version MUST match embedded firmware revision exactly
- When firmware changes revision, APK MUST be rebuilt with matching version
- All builds must maintain version traceability between Android app and firmware
- Document version relationships in build logs

## INTELLIGENCE LOGGING REQUIREMENTS
- Maintain comprehensive development intelligence logs
- Document all research findings, failed approaches, and solutions
- Record hardware limitations and capabilities discovered
- Log all version relationships and build dependencies
- Update project intelligence files after every significant discovery

## FORBIDDEN TOPICS - NEVER MENTION AGAIN
- USB CDC (Communication Device Class) - nRF54L15DK does not support
- UART over USB - not supported on target hardware
- Any USB-based serial communication approaches
- These have been proven incompatible with nRF54L15DK hardware

## TECHNICAL STANDARDS
- Target platform: nRF54L15DK exclusively
- Build system: Zephyr RTOS with CMake
- Communication: BLE only (proven working)
- Code style: Nordic SDK conventions
- Documentation: Update all relevant files with findings

## RESEARCH VALIDATION CRITERIA
- Official Nordic Semiconductor documentation required
- Working code examples from Nordic SDK mandatory
- Hardware capability confirmation from official sources
- If research shows "no examples exist" = "cannot be implemented"
- Exhaust all official channels before declaring feasibility

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT
- One task at a time, wait for completion confirmation
- Document all dead ends and failed approaches
- Maintain clear separation between proven and experimental features
- Version control everything with meaningful commit messages

## TMT TASK MANAGEMENT - MANDATORY
- ONLY work on tasks in TMT_Structured_Tasks.json that have "to_be_worked_on": true
- NEVER work on tasks with "to_be_worked_on": false
- When completing a task, IMMEDIATELY update "built": true in TMT_Structured_Tasks.json
- Status tracking is MANDATORY:
  - Check task status before starting work
  - Update "built": true after implementation is complete
  - Update "verified": true only after testing confirms functionality
- Follow this process for EVERY task:
  1. Check TMT_Structured_Tasks.json for "to_be_worked_on": true
  2. Complete the implementation
  3. Update "built": true in the JSON file
  4. Document the completion in PROJECT_CONTEXT_MEMORY.md

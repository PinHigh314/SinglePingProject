# Zephyr SDK Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to migrate the Zephyr SDK from being embedded in your project to an external, system-wide location.

## Why Migrate?
- **Cleaner project structure**: Remove thousands of SDK files from your repository
- **Better maintainability**: Easier to update Zephyr versions
- **Standard practice**: Follows Zephyr development conventions
- **Multiple projects**: Share the same SDK across different projects

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Migration Script
```bash
# From your project root directory
migrate-zephyr-sdk.bat
```

This script will:
- Move `sdk-zephyr/` to `C:\zephyr`
- Verify the migration was successful
- Clean up the source directory

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
After migration, run one of these scripts:

**Option A: Batch Script (Windows)**
```bash
setup-zephyr-env.bat
```

**Option B: PowerShell Script**
```powershell
.\setup-zephyr-env.ps1
```

### 3. Verify the Setup
The environment setup will verify that:
- `ZEPHYR_BASE` points to `C:\zephyr`
- Toolchain is accessible via PATH
- All required variables are set

## Environment Variables

Your build scripts now use these environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `ZEPHYR_BASE` | `C:\zephyr` | Location of Zephyr SDK |
| `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR` | `C:\ncs\toolchains\b8b84efebd\opt\zephyr-sdk` | Zephyr toolchain location |
| `ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT` | `zephyr` | Toolchain type |

## Updated Build Scripts

All your build scripts have been updated to use the external Zephyr location:

- âœ… `build-host-device.bat`
- âœ… `BAT files/build-mipe-device.bat`
- âœ… `BAT files/build-flash-host.bat`
- âœ… `BAT files/build-testmipe-device.bat`

## Making Environment Variables Permanent

To avoid running the setup script every time:

### Windows System Environment Variables
1. Open "System Properties" â†’ "Environment Variables"
2. Add these variables to your user or system environment:
   - `ZEPHYR_BASE` = `C:\zephyr`
   - `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR` = `C:\ncs\toolchains\b8b84efebd\opt\zephyr-sdk`
   - `ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT` = `zephyr`

### Add to PATH
Add `C:\ncs\toolchains\b8b84efebd\opt\bin` to your system PATH.

## Testing the Migration

After migration, test your setup:

1. **Run environment setup**: `setup-zephyr-env.bat`
2. **Test a build**: `build-host-device.bat` or `BAT files/build-mipe-device.bat`
3. **Verify output**: Check that builds complete successfully

## Troubleshooting

### "Zephyr SDK not found" Error
- Ensure you ran the migration script successfully
- Check that `C:\zephyr` exists and contains the SDK files
- Verify `ZEPHYR_BASE` environment variable is set correctly

### Build Failures
- Run `setup-zephyr-env.bat` before building
- Check that all environment variables are set
- Verify toolchain is accessible via PATH

### Permission Issues
- Run migration script as Administrator if needed
- Ensure you have write access to `C:\` drive

## File Structure After Migration

```
C:\zephyr\                    # Zephyr SDK (external)
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ arch\
â”œâ”€â”€ boards\
â”œâ”€â”€ drivers\
â”œâ”€â”€ include\
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel\
â”œâ”€â”€ lib\
â”œâ”€â”€ samples\
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts\
â””â”€â”€ ...

C:\Development\SinglePingProject\  # Your project (clean)
â”œâ”€â”€ Mipe\
â”œâ”€â”€ Host\
â”œâ”€â”€ MotoApp\
â”œâ”€â”€ build-host-device.bat
â”œâ”€â”€ setup-zephyr-env.bat
â””â”€â”€ ... (no more sdk-zephyr/)
```

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Cleaner repository**: No more SDK files cluttering your project
2. **Easier updates**: Update Zephyr without affecting your project
3. **Better performance**: Faster git operations and builds
4. **Standard compliance**: Follows Zephyr development best practices
5. **Multi-project support**: Use the same SDK across multiple projects

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this README for troubleshooting steps
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the migration completed successfully
4. Test with a simple build first

**Migration completed successfully!** ðŸŽ‰
Your Zephyr development environment is now properly configured and externalized.

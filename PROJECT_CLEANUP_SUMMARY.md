# SinglePing Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The project has been cleaned up and organized for the initial trail test cases. All latest working code for Mipe and Host devices and the MotoApp has been preserved in the SinglePingProject folder.

## Latest Working Versions

### Host Device Firmware
- **File:** `compiled_code/host_device_build_082025.hex`
- **Size:** 881,803 bytes
- **Features:** Beacon-only RSSI implementation (no BLE connections required)
- **Architecture:** Simplified beacon scanning mode that reads RSSI directly from advertising packets

### Mipe Device Firmware  
- **File:** `compiled_code/mipe_device_build_082025_rev008.hex`
- **Size:** 445,801 bytes
- **Features:** Stable BLE implementation with correct LED mapping

### MotoApp Android Application
- **File:** `compiled_code/MotoApp_TMT1_v3.5_BLE_Complete.apk`
- **Size:** 15,652,430 bytes
- **Features:** Complete BLE implementation with Android 12+ permission fixes

## Files Cleaned Up

### Removed Files
- `build-host-device - Copy.bat` (duplicate build script)
- `build-mipe-device - Copy.bat` (duplicate build script)

### Archived Files
All previous test builds and older versions have been moved to:
- `compiled_code/archive/` directory

## Key Features Ready for Testing

### Beacon-Only RSSI Implementation
- Host device scans for Mipe advertising packets
- Reads real RSSI values directly from advertising packets
- No BLE connections required - simpler and more reliable
- Lower power consumption
- Real-time RSSI delivery

### Stable BLE Architecture
- Both Host and Mipe devices use proven BLE patterns
- Correct LED mapping and status indicators
- Robust connection management

### Complete Android App
- BLE device discovery and connection
- RSSI data streaming and visualization  
- Distance calculation from RSSI
- Android 12+ permission compliance

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Flash Host Device:** Use `nrfjprog --program compiled_code/host_device_build_082025.hex --chiperase --verify -r`
2. **Flash Mipe Device:** Use appropriate flashing tool for the Mipe device
3. **Install MotoApp:** Install `compiled_code/MotoApp_TMT1_v3.5_BLE_Complete.apk` on Android device
4. **Test Beacon Mode:** Ensure Mipe device is advertising, Host should detect and report RSSI
5. **Verify Data Flow:** Confirm RSSI data reaches MotoApp and displays correctly

## Build Commands

- **Build Host:** `./build-host-device.bat`
- **Build Mipe:** `./build-mipe-device.bat` 
- **Build Android:** `./build-motoapp.bat`

The project is now clean and ready for initial trail testing with the beacon-only RSSI approach.
